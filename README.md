# loc_newspaper_metadata_harvesting

Informal scraper I made to harvest newspaper records from LOC records.

`newspaper_harventing.py` contains the cleanest extraction code with comments and produces the data file.

`get holding.ipynb` contains my initial extraction experiments

`get newspapership.ipynb` contains the holdings html, marc record, and json value harvesting code.

One off task for a project not really my own, specs given to me by the student working on here.  Thus not documented as fully as normal.
